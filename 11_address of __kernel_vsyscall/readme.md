**Address of __kernel_vsyscall & ELF Auxiliary Vectors**
- **Explain the technical concept**:
  - The address of `__kernel_vsyscall` serves as an entry point for userland processes or their C libraries to issue system calls. However, since this address is dynamic, it's communicated to userland processes by the kernel using the `AT_SYSINFO` parameter in the ELF auxiliary vector.
  - ELF auxiliary vectors are a set of key-value pairs provided by the kernel to user processes. They convey essential information, such as `AT_SYSINFO`, required for the process to function correctly. When a new executable is loaded, the ELF loader in the kernel sets up these vectors on the process stack alongside other data like `argc`, `argv`, and `envp`.

    ```c
    // Pseudo code for ELF loader setup
    void setup_ELF_loader(ELF_file file) {
        parse_ELF(file);
        map_program_segments();
        set_entry_point();
        initialize_stack_with_aux_vectors();
    }
    ```

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Why is the address of `__kernel_vsyscall` not fixed?**
    - It's due to address space layout randomization (ASLR), a security feature in modern operating systems. By randomizing addresses, ASLR makes it harder for attackers to predict the location of specific functions or buffers, thereby mitigating certain types of attacks.
  - **What role do ELF auxiliary vectors play in the execution of an application?**
    - ELF auxiliary vectors transfer essential information from the kernel to user processes. This information ensures processes have the necessary context and data to operate correctly, such as the dynamic address of `__kernel_vsyscall`.
  - **How can you observe the ELF auxiliary vectors of a running process?**
    - One can either use the `getauxval()` function or set the `LD_SHOW_AUXV` environment variable before executing a binary to display these vectors. For example, `LD_SHOW_AUXV=1 /bin/ls`.

- **Explain the concept in simple words**:
  - Imagine you're üöÄ launching a new video game. Before starting, the game system üéÆ (akin to the Linux kernel) gives you some crucial tips and data cards üÉè (ELF auxiliary vectors). One of these cards provides you a secret entry point üö™ (`__kernel_vsyscall` address) to a special level in the game. This entry isn't always in the same place (thanks to some magic ü™Ñ called ASLR), but the game system always ensures you have the right card to find it. Just like in the game, in real computing, these ELF auxiliary vectors give programs the critical info they need to run smoothly. And if you're curious üïµÔ∏è about these data cards, there's a special command you can use (`LD_SHOW_AUXV=1`) to see them all laid out!
