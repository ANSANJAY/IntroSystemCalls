**Why can't the application directly access hardware, and why do we need system calls?**
- **Explain the technical concept**:
  - Direct access to hardware by applications poses security, stability, and abstraction challenges. 
    - **Security**: If every application can directly access and modify hardware resources, it becomes easy for malicious software to compromise the system.
    - **Stability**: Unrestricted access can lead to system crashes, as multiple applications could simultaneously request conflicting hardware operations.
    - **Abstraction**: Direct hardware access means applications would need to be specifically tailored for different hardware configurations. This breaks the principle of hardware abstraction, where software is developed without worrying about the underlying hardware specifics.
  - System calls act as a controlled gateway between the application and the hardware, ensuring that all requests to access or modify hardware are vetted, managed, and executed safely by the kernel.

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **What could be a potential consequence of direct hardware access by an application?**
    - Potential consequences include system instability, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and making the system vulnerable to attacks.
  - **How do system calls maintain system stability while accessing hardware?**
    - System calls are designed and implemented by OS developers who ensure they interact with hardware in a standardized and safe manner. Additionally, they manage and schedule resources to avoid conflicts.

- **Explain the concept in simple words**:
  - Think of hardware like the backstage of a theater ðŸŽ­. Not everyone is allowed there because they might interfere with the props, costumes, or electrical systems. Instead, actors (applications) give their requests to stage managers (system calls), who know how to safely navigate and handle backstage operations. This ensures the show runs smoothly without any disruptions or mishaps.
