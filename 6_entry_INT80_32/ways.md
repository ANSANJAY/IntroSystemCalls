**int $0x80**
- **Explain the technical concept**:
  - In the x86 architecture of Linux, `int $0x80` represents a mechanism to invoke system calls using software interrupts.
  - To execute a system call:
    1. The user process loads the desired system call number into the `%eax` register.
    2. Parameters, if any, are placed in specific CPU registers as per ABI.
    3. The software interrupt `int $0x80` is triggered.
    4. The kernel then processes the system call and returns the result in the `%eax` register.
  - This action raises interrupt `0x80` which then calls the corresponding Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) in the kernel.
  - This mechanism is set up using the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT). Here's how it looks in the code:
    ```c
    // File: arch/x86/kernel/idt.c
    void __init idt_setup_traps(void)
    {
        idt_setup_from_table(idt_table, def_idts, ARRAY_SIZE(def_idts), true);
    }

    static const __initconst struct idt_data def_idts[] = {
        ...
        ...
        SYSG(IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR, entry_INT80_32)
    };
    #define IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR 0x80
    ```
  - In the code above, the IDT is being set up, and interrupt `0x80` (defined as `IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR`) is associated with the function `entry_INT80_32`.

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **How does the kernel know where to go when `int $0x80` is invoked?**
    - The kernel refers to the IDT, where interrupt numbers are mapped to their corresponding ISRs. For `0x80`, it is mapped to `entry_INT80_32` as shown in the code.
  - **What's the significance of `IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR` being defined as `0x80`?**
    - `IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR` is a symbolic representation for the interrupt number `0x80`. It provides clarity in the code and ensures that if the interrupt number needs to change, it can be done at one place without affecting the entire codebase.
  - **Why do we need to set up traps like `idt_setup_traps()` during initialization?**
    - Setting up traps ensures that when specific interrupts or exceptions occur, the kernel knows exactly how to handle them. By registering these in advance, the system can respond quickly and predictably.

- **Explain the concept in simple words**:
  - Think of `int $0x80` as a doorbell ðŸšªðŸ”” in a big mansion (the kernel). When someone (a user process) rings the bell, the butler (ISR) knows which room to go to, based on a pre-set list (IDT). In our case, the bell `0x80` always calls the butler from the `entry_INT80_32` room. This way, every time the doorbell rings, there's no confusion, and the right butler comes out to serve. The list of bell codes and corresponding rooms is prepared in advance so that the mansion runs smoothly.
