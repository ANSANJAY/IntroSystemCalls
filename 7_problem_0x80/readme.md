**Problems with int $0x80**
- **Explain the technical concept**:
  - The `int $0x80` mechanism involves invoking system calls via software interrupts in the x86 Linux architecture.
  - Software interrupts are a method to communicate to the operating system that a service or function is required. However, this communication method isn't the most efficient.
  - The main issue with using `int $0x80` for system calls is its inherent slowness. This stems from the need to context switch between user and kernel modes and the overhead associated with handling software interrupts.

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Why is using software interrupts like `int $0x80` slower than alternatives?**
    - Using `int $0x80` for system calls involves the overhead of context switching between user and kernel modes, as well as the general overhead that comes with handling software interrupts. This makes it a less efficient method compared to direct system call instructions.
  - **What alternatives to `int $0x80` exist in modern systems?**
    - On x86 architectures, the `syscall` and `sysenter` instructions offer faster alternatives to `int $0x80` for invoking system calls. These instructions have been optimized for efficiency and reduce the overhead associated with context switching.
  - **How does the kernel differentiate between different types of software interrupts?**
    - The kernel uses the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to map software and hardware interrupt numbers to their corresponding Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs). So, when `int $0x80` is invoked, the kernel refers to the IDT to find the corresponding ISR.

- **Explain the concept in simple words**:
  - Imagine you're trying to get the attention of a librarian üìö in a library by throwing a paper airplane ‚úàÔ∏è (software interrupt). While the librarian will eventually notice and come over, it's not the quickest way to get help. Similarly, `int $0x80` is like that paper airplane - it works, but it's not the fastest way. Modern methods are like walking up to the librarian and asking directly, which is obviously quicker and more efficient.
