**Fast System Calls**
- **Explain the technical concept**:
  - With the evolution of processor architectures, the need for faster methods of invoking system calls became evident. This was primarily due to the overhead associated with using software interrupts like `int $0x80`.
  - Fast System Calls aim to reduce this overhead by providing a mechanism to quickly transition between user mode and kernel mode, facilitating quicker system calls.
  - Two pairs of instructions were introduced to serve this purpose:
    - **For 32-bit Systems**: 
      - `sysenter`: Used to quickly jump into kernel mode.
      - `sysexit`: Used to quickly return to user mode.
      ```assembly
      sysenter
      ; Kernel code here
      sysexit
      ```
    - **For 64-bit Systems**: 
      - `syscall`: Quickly transitions to kernel mode.
      - `sysret`: Brings the execution back to user mode.
      ```assembly
      syscall
      ; Kernel code here
      sysret
      ```
  
- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Why are Fast System Calls preferred over traditional software interrupts?**
    - Fast System Calls are preferred due to their efficiency. They eliminate the need for interrupt handling overhead, making the process of invoking system calls much faster.
  - **How does the processor differentiate between `sysenter` and `syscall`?**
    - The processor differentiates based on its architecture. If it's a 32-bit system, it uses `sysenter` and `sysexit`. For 64-bit systems, it uses `syscall` and `sysret`.
  - **What happens if a process in user mode tries to execute a kernel mode instruction without using these fast system calls?**
    - The processor will raise a privilege violation exception, as user mode processes are not allowed to directly execute kernel mode instructions without proper transition mechanisms.

- **Explain the concept in simple words**:
  - Think of system calls as doors ðŸšª between the home (user mode) and outside (kernel mode). Traditional software interrupts are like opening a heavy, creaky doorâ€”it takes effort and time. Fast System Calls, on the other hand, are like automatic sliding doors. They open and close quickly, letting you move between inside and outside swiftly and smoothly. On different architectures, we have different kinds of these "sliding doors", but they all serve the purpose of making transitions more efficient. ðŸš€
