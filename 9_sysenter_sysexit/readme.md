**sysenter/sysexit**
- **Explain the technical concept**:
  - `sysenter` and `sysexit` are Fast System Call instructions introduced by Intel in their Pentium¬Æ II processors. They are tailored to swiftly transition between different protection rings, specifically to and from ring 0.
  - `sysenter`: Speedily transitions the CPU to protection ring 0 (CPL = 0) - essentially moving into kernel mode.
  - `sysexit`: Rapidly takes the CPU back to protection ring 3 (CPL = 3) - reverting to user mode.
  - Model Specific Registers (MSRs) are a pivotal component in using these instructions. They need to be set up to define certain specifics about the transition.
    - **IA32_SYSENTER_CS**: Determines the code segment for privilege level 0.
    - **IA32_SYSENTER_EIP**: Pinpoints the exact code entry point in the kernel for when a sysenter instruction gets executed.
    - **IA32_SYSENTER_ESP**: Designates the stack pointer for privilege level 0.

  - Here's the code section where the setup for these MSRs takes place:
    ```c
    void enable_sep_cpu(void)
    {
        struct tss_struct *tss;
        int cpu;

        if (!boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_SEP))
                return;

        cpu = get_cpu();
        tss = &per_cpu(cpu_tss_rw, cpu);

        tss->x86_tss.ss1 = __KERNEL_CS;
        wrmsr(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_CS, tss->x86_tss.ss1, 0);
        wrmsr(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP, (unsigned long)(cpu_entry_stack(cpu) + 1), 0);
        wrmsr(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP, (unsigned long)entry_SYSENTER_32, 0);
        put_cpu();
    }
    ```

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Why is the Fast System Call mechanism considered "more complicated" than the legacy system?**
    - The Fast System Call mechanism, particularly using `sysenter`, demands more coordination between the user-space application (often via glibc) and the kernel. This involves setting up MSRs prior to executing the instruction.
  - **What is the role of Model Specific Registers (MSRs) in this context?**
    - MSRs store specific data about the CPU and its state. For `sysenter`, they are used to detail where in the kernel the CPU should jump to and how it should behave once there. This includes specifics about the code segment, entry point, and stack pointer for kernel mode.
  - **What would happen if the MSRs aren't correctly set up before invoking `sysenter`?**
    - If MSRs aren't configured correctly, invoking `sysenter` would lead to undefined behavior, which might include system crashes, since the CPU wouldn't know where to jump or how to set its stack in kernel mode.

- **Explain the concept in simple words**:
  - Imagine wanting to quickly enter a secure facility üè¢. Traditional methods involve multiple checks, sign-ins, and walking through various gates üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöß. `sysenter` and `sysexit` are like express elevators üöÄ. With the right settings (MSRs), you press a button, and you're swiftly inside the secure area or back outside. But, you need to make sure the elevator knows which floor to stop on and how to get there. If you mess up the settings, you might end up somewhere you didn't intend to be, or the elevator might malfunction!
